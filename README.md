Nmrfilter v1.5 is an updated version of [Nmrfilter](https://github.com/stefhk3/nmrfilter), originally developed by S. Kuhn, S. Colreavy-Donnelly, J. Santana de Souza and R. M. Borges to demonstrate their [improved software pipeline for NMR mixture analysis](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/fd/c8fd00227d).

Nmrfilter v1.5 can be used to find the most likely candidate substance from a set of candidates provided by there user, thereby automatically identifying the substance from its NMR spectrum data. Nmrfilter v1.5 outputs a list of the provided candidate substances and their individual match ratings in comparison to the original substance with plots visualizing the similarities between the compounds.

Installation
============

Requirements are Java and Python. For Java, version 1.8 or higher is needed. A JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is enough, a JDK is not required.
 
Python must be version >= 3.10.2. (3.10.2 an 3.11.2 have been tested and used).

Nothing further is needed, as the program creates a Python virtual environment installid all the needed packages.

Anaconda
--------

There are 2 Anaconda environments available for use:

`nmrfilter` for running the program using the CPU

Install by running
`conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml`

`nmrfiltergpu`  for running the program using the GPU
Install by running
`conda env create -f environment-gpu.yml`

Activate the environments by running `conda activate <environment name>`

When using the Anaconda, the main run-script will take care of the unnecessary nesting.

Use of Respredict
=================


[Respredict](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-019-0374-3) is another way of predicting NMR spectral properties using machine learning. Possibly yielding better results, respredict is available for use in Nmrfilter v1.5. It can be enabled in the properties file, see **Glossary**.

Use of Respredict requires extra packages, rendering the use of bundled Anaconda environments necessary. See **Anaconda** for further information.

Jupyter Notebook
==================

Jupyter Notebook must be installed locally when to be used. Jupyter Notebook can be enabled by first running:

`jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension`

Running
=======

Nmrfilter v1.5 works on projects, where each project is a folder. Example projects can be found [here.](https://github.com/stefhk3/nmrfilterprojects) The folder must contain the following files:
- A list of candidate structures in the form of SMILES, one structure per line. File name can be configured by the `msmsinput` property.
- Measured spectrum data in a .csv file. The file must be a list of shifts, coordinates seperated by a tab. <sup>13</sup>C shift in the first dimension, <sup>1</sup>H shift in the second. Each row corresponds to one shift. HMBC and HSQC shifts should be included. File name can be configured by the `spectruminput` property. 

With projects in place, Nmrfilter v1.5 will produce an output ranking the candidates.


Before running, in the `nmrproc.properties` file, the `datadir` property must be set to the absolute path of the folder containing project folders. Additionally, in the `nmrproc.properties` select the right solvent used in the mixture. See **Glossary** for available options.  NB! Each project can have their own properties file whose properties will be prioritized over the default program file.

With these files in place, the program can be run by using `./nmrfilter.sh <project name>` on Linux or `./nmrfilter.bat <project name>` on Windows. Replace `<project name>` with the name of the project (folder name) you want the predictions for. When running, the program creates a Python virtual environment installing everything needed for its use. If you prefer to use the external environment, use an Anaconda environment provided. 


Following features are available:
- HSQCTOCSY shifts can be included. Include the shifts in the `spectruminput` file and set the `usehsqctocsy` property to `true`.
- Debug output can be produced by setting the property `debug` to true. As a prequisite, a file `testallnames.txt` needs to be included in the project folder. The file should contain the names of the compounds in the same order as in the `msmsinput` file.
- Parameters for tolerances and resolutions for the clustering and network algorithm can be set. See **Glossary** for details.
- To use respredict, set the property `usedeeplearning` to `true`. See **Use of Respredict** for further information. 
- Nmrfilter v1.5 uses a offline reference database for the HOSE code based spectra predictions. The database can be updated by running `./nmrfilter.sh --update`. The database gets updated on a monthly basis.
- Nmrfilter v1.5 can be used for batch simulation of desired NMR spectra. Using the `--simulate` flag when running, e.g `./nmrfilter.sh pbolduswithhsqctocsy --simulate`, Nmrfilter v1.5 will simulate spectras for the candidates. `testallnames.txt` file is mandatory (may be placeholder names) together with the `msmsinput` SMILES file. The program will produce spectra for the experiments specified in `nmrproc.properties`. These can be found at `<project-folder>/sim_plots`.

NB! While the file `testallnames.txt` is not mandatory for the identification, it is highly recommended to include it. Without this file, no plots will be produced for further manual analysis/verification of results.

See **Glossary** for information about all the configurable properties.

The following table contains all the properties in the `nmrproc.properties` file with explanations, options and default values shown.

| Property | Description | Default |

| predictionoutput | Name of the file containing simulated spectra shifts of the candidate substances .  | resultprediction.csv |
| result | File name of the generated result file | result.txt |
| solvent | Name of solvent if used. Choices available are `Methanol-D4 (CD3OD)`, `Chloro-form-D1 (CDC13)` and `Dimethylsulph-oxide-D6 (DMSO-D6, C2D6SO)`. Otherwise use `Unreported`.  | `Methanol-D4 (CD3OD)` |
